# Candidate Matcher

In an age where most of the major news networks are seeming to display a rising political bias, Candidate Matcher is intended to provide you with a short and sweet, unbiased comparative guide between the current major democratic candidates running for the 2020 election.

## Getting Started

Candidate Matcher is available online now at https://candidate-matcher.herokuapp.com. You can immediately see all the candidates with their views on key issues, and then you can compare on an issue by issue basis by clicking directly on an issue underneath the candidate cards. The site also allows you to see a full list of all the politicians that govern you based on an address you provide in the search bar!
